# HubSpot CMS Deploy Action

Automatically deploy a HubSpot CMS project to your account ðŸš€

## Usage
In your GitHub repo, create two new [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) for:
- `HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` - This is your HubSpot account ID
- `HUBSPOT_PERSONAL_ACCESS_KEY` - Your [personal access key](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/personal-cms-access-key)

This guide walks through setting up a new workflow file that automatically uploads new changes on your `main` branch to your HubSpot CMS account. If you're adding a deployment step to an existing workflow, you can [skip ahead](#integrating-into-an-existing-workflow).

1. In your project, create a GitHub Action workflow file at `.github/workflows/main.yml`
2. Copy the following example workflow into your `main.yml` file.
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.3
      - name: HubSpot Deploy Action
        uses: HubSpot/hubspot-cms-deploy-action@v1.5
        with:
          src_dir: <src>
          dest_dir: <src>
          portal_id: ${{ secrets.hubspot_portal_id }}
          personal_access_key: ${{ secrets.hubspot_personal_access_key }}
```
3. Replace the `src_dir` with the directory of your CMS project in your repo
4. Replace the `dest_dir` with the directory it should be uploaded to in your target account
5. Commit and merge your changes

*Note:* Do not change the `portal_id` or `personal_access_key` values in your workflow. Auth related values should only be stored as GitHub secrets.

### Deploying to a staging account
If you'd like to auto-deploy to a staging branch, you can create an additional workflow that runs on `push` your QA branch and deploy to a different HubSpot. account
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - qa
...
portal_id: ${{ secrets.staging_account_id }}
```

### Integrating into an existing workflow
To add HubSpot CMS deployment as a step in an existing GitHub Action workflow, add the following step:
```yaml
- name: HubSpot Deploy Action
  uses: HubSpot/hubspot-cms-deploy-action@v1.5
  with:
    src_dir: <src> ## ex. src
    dest_dir: <src> ## ex. my-theme
    portal_id: ${{ secrets.hubspot_portal_id }}
    personal_access_key: ${{ secrets.hubspot_personal_access_key }}
```

*Note:* You can configure your action to run based on different criteria, such as pushing to a QA branch. Learn more about events that trigger actions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows).
